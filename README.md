# Predicting Flight Delays :airplane:

The growth of the aviation sector has made flight delaysmore common across the world.  They cause inconvenienceto the travellers and incur monetary losses to the airlines.We analysed the various factors responsible for flight delaysand applied machine learning models such as Random For-est, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and NaiveBayes to predict whether a given flight would be delayed ornot.  The `XGBoost Classifier` performed exceptionally well, giving an accuracy of `0.8`8 and an AUC of `0.93`.
